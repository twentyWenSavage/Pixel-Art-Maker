## About The Project

### *HTML and CSS files are from Udacity starter codes*

### What Will I Build?

You’ll build a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas! Check out this example:

You'll be given starter code, including HTML and CSS, to build the application. You'll write JavaScript code that lets the user create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!

Your users should be able to:
<ul>
<li>Dynamically set the size of the table as an _N_ by _M_ grid.
<li>Choose a color.
<li>Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.
</ul>

Your primary task is to implement the makeGrid() function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.

### What Skills Do I Need?
In this project, you'll use your front-end programming skills including:

<ul>
<li>Defining variables with const and let
<li>Accessing the DOM using methods of the document object
<li>Declaring functions and attaching them to DOM objects as event listeners
<li>Writing nested loops and using loop variables
</ul>

### How Does This Help My Career?

Interacting with the DOM — the structure of a web page — is one of the most fundamental skills for a front-end web developer. Mastering event listeners is essential to creating user interfaces — and to quite a few other things.
